# HOW TO ADD SKUCET LOGO ✅

## Quick Fix for Logo Display

The logo is currently not visible because you need to add the actual image file. Here's how:

### **Step 1: Save the Logo Image**

1. **Right-click** on the SKUCET logo image you have
2. **Save it as**: `skucet-logo.png`
3. **Save location**: `frontend/public/skucet-logo.png`

**Full path should be:**
```
C:\Users\Yuvakiran\OneDrive\Desktop\SKU\frontend\public\skucet-logo.png
```

### **Step 2: Image Specifications**

For best quality:
- **Format**: PNG (with transparent background preferred)
- **Minimum Size**: 500 x 500 pixels
- **Recommended**: 1000 x 1000 pixels or higher
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading

### **Step 3: Verify**

After saving the logo:
1. Refresh your browser (`Ctrl + F5` or `Cmd + Shift + R`)
2. The logo should now appear in:
   - Navbar (65px height)
   - Hero section (150px height)
   - Footer (60px height)
   - Browser tab/favicon

## Alternative: If You Don't Have the Logo File

If you need to extract the logo from the image you showed:

1. **Open the image** in an image editor (Paint, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
2. **Crop** just the logo portion
3. **Remove background** (make it transparent if possible)
4. **Save as** PNG
5. **Place in** `frontend/public/skucet-logo.png`

## Current File Location

The system is currently looking for the logo at:
```
/skucet-logo.png
```

Which resolves to:
```
frontend/public/skucet-logo.png
```

## After Adding Logo

Your landing page will show:
- ✅ SKUCET logo in navbar (top left)
- ✅ Large logo in hero section (center, animated)
- ✅ Logo in footer
- ✅ Logo as browser favicon (tab icon)

---

**That's it! Just add the logo image and refresh the browser!** 🎓
