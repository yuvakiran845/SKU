# ✅ PREMIUM V2 STUDENT DASHBOARD UPGRADE

## 🚀 "STRIPE-LEVEL" POLISH COMPLETE

### **1. TIMETABLE & SCHEDULE UPGRADES** 📅
- **Full Subject Names**: Mapped all short codes (e.g., "ML", "C&NS") to their full academic titles (e.g., "Machine Learning", "Cryptography & Network Security").
- **Premium Table Format**:
  - **Dark Black Borders**: Rigid, high-contrast lines for separation.
  - **LUNCH COLUMN**: Distinct vertical "LUNCH BREAK" section.
  - **Dashes**: Replaced empty slots with clear indicators.
- **Daily Schedule (Overview)**:
  - Intelligently filters and displays *all* subjects for the current day.
  - Uses the same mapped full names for clarity.

### **2. ATTENDANCE CARDS (RE-ENGINEERED)** 💎
- **New Layout**:
  - Removed "clumsy" tight spacing.
  - **Spacious**: Increased card size and padding significantly.
- **Color Coding**:
  - **Present**: 🟢 Green stats.
  - **Absent**: 🔴 Red stats.
  - **Total**: 🔵 Blue/Neutral stats.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Big percentage number, bold subject title, and a clean progress bar.

### **3. PERSONAL PROFILE MODAL** 👤
- **Interactive**: Click on your Name/Avatar in the top-right navbar.
- **Modal View**: Opens a sleek, glass-morphism overlay showing detailed student info:
  - Full Name, Roll Number, Email.
  - Department, Semester.
  - Large Avatar.

### **4. UI/UX REFINEMENTS** 🎨
- **Enhanced Padding**: Every element has room to breathe, following Stripe's design principles.
- **Typography**: crisp `Inter` font with improved weights (Regular, Medium, Bold, ExtraBold).
- **Shadows**: Soft but deep shadows (`--shadow-hover`) for that "floating" feel.
